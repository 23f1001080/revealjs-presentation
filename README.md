# revealjs-presentation
This repository contains my TDS course assignment where I created an interactive RevealJS presentation featuring markdown slides, animated fragments, code highlighting, math formulas, and speaker notes. The presentation is fully deployed using GitHub Pages for easy access and evaluation.
